        Envision this: there is a technology currently undergoing testing that,
        when released to the public, will become a long-awaited revolution in
        energy. This new technology promises to be safer and more efficient than
        anything we have on the market now. It will affect that which we
        consider mundane — power tools, toys, laptops, smartphones — and that
        which we consider exceptional — medical devices, spacecraft, and the
        innovative new vehicle designs needed to wean us off of fossil fuels. We
        have known about this technology for centuries, yet until now we have
        only been able to take small steps towards its creation. Billions of
        dollars are pouring into research and billions more will be made once
        the technology has been perfected and released.

        This description may sound a lot like that of fusion power. Yet it’s
        actually referring to the upcoming innovations in the realm of battery
        technology — specifically that of solid-state batteries. And while both
        fusion power and solid-state batteries have been labeled technologies of
        the future but never of today, advancements and investments in
        solid-state materials have increased tremendously over the years. Today
        not only are there many major companies and credible researchers
        involved, it seems we may finally start seeing these batteries released
        in just the next few years.

        What can we expect once this elusive, transformative technology is
        finally ready for mass production?

        Batteries are nothing more than devices that store chemical energy and
        convert it into electrical energy. They have four main parts: the
        cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator. The cathode and anode are
        the electrodes. Our electrical current is produced when electrons are
        passed from one electrode to the other. In this case, electrons are
        passed from the negatively charged anode to the positively charged
        cathode. The role of the two electrodes, then, is to produce our
        electric current. The electrolyte solution allows positively charged
        ions to flow between the two electrodes. This balances the flow of the
        electrons. Finally, the separator keeps the two electrodes apart and
        prevents the battery from short-circuiting.
      </p>
      <p id="58e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">
        There is one important difference between our current batteries and the
        solid-state batteries of the future: the electrolyte. Current
        lithium-ion batteries have a liquid electrolyte. Unfortunately, certain
        compounds present in the liquid electrolyte allow for the growth of
        crystalline structures known as dendrites. The dendrites produce long,
        sharp whiskers that can puncture the separator and cause
        short-circuiting, consequently leading to dangerous explosions. As their
        name suggests, solid-state batteries have a solid electrolyte that
        inhibits the growth of these harmful dendrites. Not to mention something
        astounding happens once the electrolyte is switched from liquid to
        solid.
      </p>
      <p id="b42a" data-selectable-paragraph="">
        The battery has a higher energy density, the risk of fires and
        explosions is greatly reduced, it takes up less space, and it is able to
        operate in a wider range of temperatures. Let’s take a look, for
        example, at what this would mean for vehicles.

        By far the largest drawback of electric vehicles today is their limited
        driving range. An average electric vehicle will get a range of 250–300
        miles (402–483 km) on a full charge. Fully charging the vehicle takes
        anywhere from an hour to 17 hours depending on whether the vehicle is
        charging at a station or using a standard outlet at home. Yet electric
        vehicles are expected to continue growing in popularity, eventually
        dominating the automotive sector. To reach this point they will need to
        expand their range to at least 450 miles (724 km) while remaining
        affordable to the consumer.
      </p>
      <p id="ec3c">Let’s now introduce the solid-state battery.</p>
      <p id="56ad" data-selectable-paragraph="">
        The driving range of electric vehicles becomes double or triple the
        current number. Companies can choose between making a smaller, lighter
        battery that charges faster or leaving the battery the same size with a
        much more extensive range. Charge times, too, are reduced to just 15
        mins. If we look at Samsung’s advancements in solid state batteries we
        see they were able to develop a battery that can be charged and
        discharged over 1,000 times with a range of 500 miles (805 km) per
        charge. This is a battery life of 500,000 miles. And all while being
        able to operate efficiently in more extreme temperatures.

      <p id="a80c" data-selectable-paragraph="">
        Something like this could be the end of gas-powered vehicles. For
        laptops and smartphones it means the devices could last days on a single
        (very fast) charge, with the overall lifespan of the battery increasing
        from just 2 years to over 10. Medical devices could become more portable
        and compact while the larger temperature range means solid-state
        batteries could have applications in future space technology.
      </p>
      <p id="ae21" data-selectable-paragraph="">
        This potential has not escaped the attention of powerful companies.
        Volkswagen, Ford, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota, and Bill Gates have all invested
        billions of dollars into solid-state research.
        <mark class="abz aca tg"
          >The Bill Gates backed company known as QuantumScape has made
          solid-state batteries with layers of ceramic that are resistant to
          dendrite growth and are able to operate in lower temperatures.</mark
        >
        Toyota is planning limited release of vehicles with solid-state
        batteries by 2025. And yet the most exciting breakthrough comes from
        someone you’ve probably never heard about.
